		            Earlier this year, OpenIDEO and William Penn Foundation launched the #ECBookChallenge, an open call for childrenâ€™s book manuscripts.
		            I was thrilled to be a part of the challenge as a work for hire illustrator! I collaborated with author, Lesile Bockol, to bring the manuscript and idea alive.
		            Over 500 manuscripts were submitted and the Top Manuscript has been announced. Check it out <a id="aboutEmail" href="https://ideo.to/ybJhVJ">here</a>.
